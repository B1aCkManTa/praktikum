# 3D Visualization of an SIR environment - Is Unity viable?

This Project was created to apply the RiMEA Guidelines: https://rimeaweb.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/rimea_richtlinie_3-0-0_-_d-e.pdf to Unity NavMeshAgent.
This is to validate the use of Unity NavMeshAgent as a tool for Simulating crowds, Where RiMEA Scenario 1,4,6 where tested.

 
## How to use

1- Download Unity Hub and install Unity

2- Pull the project.

3- There are 3 scenes, one for each RiMEA Scenario (1,4,6), load the corresponding scene to test out and unload the others.
  
   - for RiMEA Scenario 1,6 you can just run the scene
   - for RiMEA Scenario 4, select the spawner in the scene and adjust the number of pedestrians to spawn, creating different density of pedestrian per meter square.
